# Python File CSV
# csv — CSV File Reading and Writing.
# The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases.
# CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in RFC 4180.
# The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different applications.
# These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources.
# Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module
# which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer.
# The csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.
# It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,”
# without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel.
# Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats.
# The csv module’s reader and writer objects read and write sequences.
# Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary form using the DictReader and DictWriter classes.
# class csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames, restval='', extrasaction='raise', dialect='excel', *args, **kwds)
# Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows.
# The fieldnames parameter is a sequence of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the writerow() method are
# written to file f. 

import csv

with open('names.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name']

    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Baked', 'last_name': 'Beans'})

    writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Lovely', 'last_name': 'Spam'})
    writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Wonderful', 'last_name': 'Spam'})
