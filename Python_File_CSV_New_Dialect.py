# Python File CSV
# csv — CSV File Reading and Writing.
# The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases.
# CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way in RFC 4180.
# The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different applications.
# These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources.
# Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module
# which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer.
# The csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.
# It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,”
# without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel.
# Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats.
# The csv module’s reader and writer objects read and write sequences.
# Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary form using the DictReader and DictWriter classes.
# Registering a new encoding dialect:
 
import csv

csv.register_dialect('unixpwd', delimiter=':', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)

with open('passwd', newline='') as f:

    reader = csv.reader(f, 'unixpwd')
