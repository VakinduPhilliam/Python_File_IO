# shelve — Python object persistence
# A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with “dbm” databases is that the values (not the keys!)
# in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects — anything that the pickle module can handle.
# This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects.
# The keys are ordinary strings.
#
# To summarize the interface (key is a string, data is an arbitrary object):
# 

import shelve

d = shelve.open(filename)  # open -- file may get suffix added by low-level
                           # library

d[key] = data              # store data at key (overwrites old data if
                           # using an existing key)
data = d[key]              # retrieve a COPY of data at key (raise KeyError
                           # if no such key)
del d[key]                 # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                           # if no such key)

flag = key in d            # true if the key exists
klist = list(d.keys())     # a list of all existing keys (slow!)

# as d was opened WITHOUT writeback=True, beware:

d['xx'] = [0, 1, 2]        # this works as expected, but...
d['xx'].append(3)          # *this doesn't!* -- d['xx'] is STILL [0, 1, 2]!

# having opened d without writeback=True, you need to code carefully:

temp = d['xx']             # extracts the copy
temp.append(5)             # mutates the copy

d['xx'] = temp             # stores the copy right back, to persist it

# or, d=shelve.open(filename,writeback=True) would let you just code
# d['xx'].append(5) and have it work as expected, BUT it would also
# consume more memory and make the d.close() operation slower.

d.close()                  # close it
